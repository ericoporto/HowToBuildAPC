##PSU jumpstart and the Paperclip method
http://forum.overclock3d.net/showthread.php?t=394

What is jump starting? Jump starting is tricking your PSU into thinking that the
power button on your computer has been pushed, making the psu switch on without
the need for a motherboard or any switches.

You may be asking yourself why you would ever need to jump start a psu. The
answer is, you never know when you might have to! Take for instance testing new
devices / equipment outside of the case when you don't have your motherboard
wired or powered up. For us water coolers out there, we have to do an initial
12-24 hour leak test of our systems before installing components. How do you
suspect we do that without a motherboard? Answer: Jump start! Trust me this will
come in handy some day even if you can't think of a reason that you'd ever have
to do this right now.

HOW TO JUMP START YOUR POWER SUPPLY (PAPER CLIP TEST)

1. Turn off the Power Supply for your safety, set the I/O switch on the back of
power supply to the "O" status.

2. Unplug the AC power cord from the power supply.

3. Unplug all devices from the power supply.

4. Plug the AC power cord into the power supply. Have the AC coming directly
from wall outlet without any filters or UPS.

5. Short between the green and black wires on the 24-pin connector (as show
    below), with a paper clip or piece of wire. In case if you canâ€™t see wire
    colors, locate connector lock, place connector facing the lock up and short
    4th and 5th pins (counting from left to right) in the upper row.

6. Turn on the Power Supply, set the I/O switch of the power supply to the "I"
status.

7. See if the power supply fan is running. If so, your supply is probably good.

To test fanless and semi-passive power supplies you may try to use some simple
devices. For example, external fan with 4-pin Molex connector, which will rotate
if PSU is turned on, or HDD, which will vibrate.

Note: Avoid using more than one device while performing Jump Start. Connect this
device before turning PSU on.


##Notes on Computer Cases
Notes from the video by Linus here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2szW0ROdNHs

**Mini Tower**
1-2 drives
1 GPU
Usually mATX

**Mid Tower**
Most commom
3-4
Usually ATX
6-8 HDDs
1-2 GPU

**Full Tower**
5 or more external
ATX, EATX
Better cooling
Up to 4 GPU

**Desktop**
Are actually the horizontal cases, usually in the HTPC niche

**Small Form Factors**
Mini-ITX

**Cube Case**
Shaped like cubes, can be find in many different volumes.



##Notes on TDP

This video by Linus (TECH) is really good:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDWO177BjZY

TDP is a measure on dissipate heat, and not consumed power even though
related.

Processors need to be kept below optimal operating temperature called
t-junction at which point they will just turn themselves down if you have
inadequatly cooling solution. But great cooling can also help improve
performance when using the latest Intel CPU, specially if overclocking.
