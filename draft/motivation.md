A coworker and also friend of mine asked me opinion on a computer he was about
to buy. This computer is a 5 thousand dollars power hungry desktop computer.
When I asked him what he would be doing with it, he said browsing the web,
writing text files and some heavy simulations on OpenFoam, for which he plans on
running Ubuntu as main OS. Now it's important to say that my work is not
computer related, as is this guy, so I asked what computer he has at home and
why it isn't enough and then he tells me he has no computer at home, never had
and has mostly use computer at the university, the company and lend his wife old
laptop. This is a 50 year old co-worker, who does most things the old way.

Once we stated talking it hit me that he had always used computer as tools -
which you should, it's ok - but never had curiosity about what was inside them.
So I started to explain things, he wants a big monitor, a nice keyboard (this
guy has really big hands) and doesn't need mobility. We found out that you can
use AWS from Amazon to do heavy run of the software for little money, and I am
now designing a build for him while trying to explain what each component does,
and couldn't find a nice short and concise text in my language (brazillian
portuguese) for him to read - there are lots of very detailed, very advanced
books though.

The English version is here since it wasn't really that hard to write and I
could use more eyes reading what I had wrote so I could come up with better
content, correct my mistakes and learn a little on writing in English.
