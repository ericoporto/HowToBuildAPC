##Notes on TDP

This video by Linus (TECH) is really good:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDWO177BjZY

TDP is a measure on dissipate heat, and not consumed power even though
related.

Processors need to be kept below optimal operating temperature called
t-junction at which point they will just turn themselves down if you have
inadequatly cooling solution. But great cooling can also help improve
performance when using the latest Intel CPU, specially if overclocking.
